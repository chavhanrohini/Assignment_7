    "Raw strings (prefixing the string with an 'r') are often used in Regex objects to prevent Python's escape sequences from interfering with the regular expression pattern. Since regular expressions often contain backslashes ('\\'), which are also escape characters in Python strings, using a raw string ensures that the backslashes are treated as literal characters within the regular expression.\n"
